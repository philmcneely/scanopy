//! The event a dependency losing a member is.
//!
//! A dependency's members outlive what they name: when a member's binding changes hands or its
//! service is deleted, the member stays and names an id that no longer resolves, and the user
//! decides what replaces it. This says it happened, in the same warning category as
//! [`SubnetCorrection`]: a row changed on its own initiative, and an operator who sees a
//! dependency come up short should find out why without turning up the log level.
//!
//! Published by the dependency service's subscriber on a binding's or a service's `Deleted`, read
//! from the reason it carries, one per affected member.
//!
//! [`SubnetCorrection`]: crate::server::subnets::r#impl::correction_events::SubnetCorrection
